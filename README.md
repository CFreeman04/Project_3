# WaffleHouse
## Initial Ideas List


### Drafted Ideas
Waffle House Star Reviews Vs Income of the local population

### Plans
- Use Google Location Data for Waffle Houses to get lat/long
- Use Yelp or Google Place Data to pull star count reviews of Waffle House Locations
- Use demographics info (census or kaggle csv) to pull income data for zipcodes Waffle Houses are located in
- Are reviews related to size of population (maybe density)


### Assignments
- Cross Reference reviews by location / income
- Make heat map for waffle house reviews (good vs bad = 5 > 1 stars)
- Population Size vs Reviews 
- Add in examples of Fights or Shootings, do they still have good reviews?
